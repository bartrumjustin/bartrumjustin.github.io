                    <li class="anx">ANXIETY
                        <p class="define-anx"> Anxiety can be a panicky, groundless feeling. It can come on without warning and seemingly out of nowhere. I help clients explore the root of their anxiety and regain a sense of control over their life.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p class="define-dep"> Everyone has felt a little down before, but not everyone has felt the crushing loneliness, pit-in-your-stomach, weight-on-your-shoulders hopelessness of depression. Right now it might feel like no one can help, but what do you have to lose? I do more than teach proper techniques to avoid bad feelings. I support clients in seeking out purpose and freedom.</p>

                    <li>COUNSELING FOR COUNSELORS/PASTORS
                        <p class="define-ccc">Individuals who provide counseling services for others tend to have more well-developed defense mechanisms. It is helpful to have someone who is able to manage the nuance of cutting through the B.S. while still allowing for a space free of judgement--a space where someone who is used to helping others can let their guard down and explore themselves more deeply. Even if you have the skills to help others, oftentimes counselors don't take the time to help themselves. I attempt to create a space where well trained counselors are able to use their own skills to walk through daily stressors, trauma, and the human experience--since all people are human and are allowed to have the same struggles.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>EXISTENTIAL THERAPY
                        <p class="define-exist">Existential Therapy deals with 5 common core human struggles that are identified cross culturally. These 5 common struggles are the inevitability of death, the responsibility of freedom, inescapable isolation, the sense of meaningfulness or meaninglessness, and identity. I help guide clients in wrestling with these concerning topics, accepting the reality of their situation, and maturing into a person who can come to peace with and be satisfied with their life.</p>

            <p class="define-work">Everyone goes through difficult seasons of life, and at some point everyone needs a little help. Whether you are seeking peace from inner turmoil, struggling to let go of a lost love one, battling to keep your marriage alive, or exploring new growth, it's important to have a trained professional to help you along the way. I use traditional time-tested counseling approaches combined with the newest developments in the field to provide a personalized counseling experience. Every person is different, and that is why a tailored approach to counseling is helpful in dealing with your unique struggles. It is my job to create a therapeutic experience that can help you develop a life-story (or personal narrative) that you are proud to call your own.</p>
